# Ethereum and Ether

---
## Content

**Ethereum**

Ethereum is a global computer: turing complete virtual machine. It is refered to as EVM: Ethereum Virtual Machine.

**Ether**

Ether on the other hand is a cryptocurrency. The blockchain that Ether uses is generated by the EVM.

**Nodes**

Each conected computer that runs an EVM implementation is called a node. Each of these nodes runs each of the commands sent to the EVM.

**Generation of Ether**

As with Bitcoin, Ether is also mined by nodes via Proof of Work. Currently, the Casper Protocol, Ethereum's way to implement Proof of Stake is being developed in order to reduce the energy consuption of the network.
